# Feedback from Group

Below are a few suggestions from my group that influenced my overall lesson.

## Scaffolding question(s)

When I proposed the three differentiated options for the activity, I included my prediction that many students might not even know how/where to begin. My peers suggested being ready to ask questions like:

> What concepts do you know that might apply here?

For example, students have learned conditionals, loops, arrays, etc; and exercises rely on some concepts more than others. This will at least get them started. If necessary, I can hint towards the concept, and students will still need to consider how to implement them.

## Use paper

My peers reminded me of "keys to success." By viewing my attached slides, you can see that drawing arrows helps to see the neighboring `2`s. Likewise, students might benefit from a diagram, table, etc.

## Real-world metaphors

For the first example (swapEnds), the classic swap algorithm must be used. For that reason, nudging stuck students in the right direction could look like considering a real-world example, such as how to swap the contents of two cups (i.e. coffee and water).

## Prepare first line of code

As many students struggle not only with getting started writing the plain-English pseudocode, my peers suggested also being ready to provide the first line of Javascript to get students' momentum going.

I found all of these suggestions extremely helpful, particularly with supporting students during their activity as a means to differentiate even further.
