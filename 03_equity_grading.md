# Equity Grading

## Listen to the following podcast, and answer the questions:
[CS-Ed Podcast: Season 2, Episode 4: Grading for Equity](https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/02/15/season-2-episode-4-grading-for-equity/)

### Do you agree with the general sentiment or not? Do you have specific points of agreement/disagreement?

I have mixed feelings about this podcast. Here are some specifics:

#### Agree
* Teachers are given very little direction "how to grade." However we grade, we as teachers have a sense of how students are doing simply by taking the time to look at their work. But numerical grades are meant to be communicated to students, families, and throughout avenues of their future (colleges, employers, etc). Thus some kind of normalization would help communicate what a "B" actually means (as Feldmen says, a student mostly knowing content vs a student who very much knows the content but has behavior issues). In all areas, it would be nice to be able to compare apples to apples, so to speak.
* Students often seem to be motivated by points, and that becomes the "it." I often urge students to chase the learning rather than the points (and thus the points will naturally follow), but that's hard for them to do if the points are either inconsistent, non-transparent, or simply unattainable. 
* Feldmen's approach to submitting work late has a very humanistic, professional approach. It involves respectfully communicating on the students' part, and explicitly setting those expectations on the teachers' part. I think this is a great way to prepare students for their futures and how to handle the "unwritten rules" that were discussed in the podcast.

#### Disagree
* Feldmen's point on rubrics makes me give a double-take. While in theory I like the idea of giving rubrics for qualitative feedback over quantitative data, I have a qualm with rubrics: I have seen too many rubrics that are subjective. Words like "mostly" vs "partly" vs "barely" leave much to be interpreted. There is still much normalization that would have to happen with rubrics in order for them to communicate the consistency for which Feldmen is hoping.
* According to Feldmen, it is important to not make practice part of a grade, much like throwing free throws in preparation for a basketball game. My problem with this is
* The problem with removing the late penalty is that it creates more work for the teachers. My understanding of removing a late penalty is to provide empathy for the students who need extra time due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e. having to work outside of school, family emergencies, etc). And while I am 100% empathetic to that, other students will undoubtedly take advantage of this policy. They procrastinate, and yet still do well, so their motivation to turn in assignments on-time is reduced. Yet like many other teachers I know, I grade in batches, i.e. open an assignment and grade all students at once. Multiplying courses by assignments by students yields an extremely high number of pieces of work to look at and upon which to give feedback, so efficiency is crucial. But when a students turns in work late, that workflow is disrupted. The teacher must open the work individually, open the original assignment/rubric separately, re-send a mail merge (or whatever the workflow is), etc. I have experienced this first-hand, and it is completely overbearing when I get hundreds of late submissions at the end of a marking period when the deadline is finally real.

### Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?

My school has uniformly adapted much of Feldmen's policies, i.e. leniency on late work and no participation factored into a grade. As discussed above, I have mixed feelings about things like late work. But another part of Feldmen's work is the desire to tweak the 0-100 scale. Last year my school implemented a minimum grade of 55 for work that was not submitted. I think this communicates mathematically incorrect performance, as I documented [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mOMxg4v-fL1oQdC9pDm-SJmzsJwkkpfaNDEwJwRraCw/edit#slide=id.p). In short, it has the opposite effect as a curve, making it harder for students who are already doing well to raise their grade. Now everyone's grades are inflated, and a typical "75-80" kid is scoring in the low 90s simply because of this grade inflation.

I have already implemented much of what Feldman has laid out, either because it is a school-wide policy, or because I agree with the idea that a grade should reflect mastery. What I struggle with is how to actually put some of it into practice. For example, where to draw the line with revised work. If a student performs poorly on a practice assignment, and they are given the chance to revise it, either A) it's not worth points and I've found that they don't want to revise it, or B) it is worth points and teachers are now overwhelmed with a flood of re-grading work. Again, it all comes down to the scale of assignments, and learning how to give less (but more meaningful) practice and feedback.
