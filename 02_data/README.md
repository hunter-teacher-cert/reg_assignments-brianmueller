# Data Assignment

## The purpose of this assignment is to practically apply Javascript to a data set.

Files
* [starter.html](starter.html) is your starter code
* [example.html](example.html) is a full working example

---

## Instructions

* Use the [starter](starter.html) code as a starting point. 
* Choose a data set that interests you from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Click **API** > copy the **API Endpoint URL**. Paste that as the value of the `url` property in the **starter**.
* Consider what kind of question a user might **ask** regarding that data set. Use your knowledge of the following concepts to write that code that will **answer** the question:
  * Variables
  * String manipulation
  * Arrays
  * Conditionals
  * Functions
  * Loops
  * Objects
  * _NOTE: you do not have to use ALL of these, but you can if you need to._
* Consider the [example](example.html), where a user can enter the buses that go near their home, and the program will iterate through all of the data in the [2019 DOE NYC High School Directory](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-DOE-High-School-Directory/uq7m-95z8) and report all of the high schools along that bus route.
