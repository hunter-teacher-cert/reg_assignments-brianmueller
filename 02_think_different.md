# Think Different

## Describe 3 diffferent strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.

Things to consider
* What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
* Are students being grouped? If so, how?
* What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
* Anything else you deem important

### Strategy 1: Tough/er/est

I use this strategy to differentiate **ability**. 

When students are grouped homogenously, I will use this differentation strategy as their work in pairs. Otherwise, the strategy only seems to work well if students are working independently. The one caveat is if the "tougher" task is simply an extension on to the "tough", and likewise with "toughest" adding on to "tougher". If they are completely different tasks, hetergeneously-paired students might not agree on which task to pursue. 

The goal here is to give students both:
* A balance of success and challenge
* Agency, and thus buy-in

### Strategy 2: Choice in an open-ended project

I use this strategy to differentiate **interest**.

Whether students are grouped homogeneously, heterogeneously, or independently, giving them a task where they simply demonstrate their knowledge/skills on an open canvas gives them a chance to really buy-in and have fun with the project. For example, students use their knowledge of HTML/CSS to make a "movie webpage" that advertises a fake movie. Students tend to _love_ this project because it gives them a chance to practice the new concepts in a way that is fun and creative. More often than not, students work in pairs because they collectively brainstorm elements of the project in a fun upward spiral.

The goal is ultimately to get students to have fun and see themselves in their project, but with the main purpose of getting them to practice the new skills.

### Strategy 3: Limited choice in a guided project

I use this strategy to differentiate **ability** _and_ **interest**.

After teaching students many new concepts, I will sometimes show students many completed projects, one of which they must "reverse engineer". I rank them in difficulty, thus giving students a chance to place themselves in their own comfort level, but there are often multiple projects for each difficulty level, still giving students agency in working on a project they find interesting. One example of this strategy is found in my [JS DOM Unit Plan](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/currdev_unit_plan-jsdom/blob/main/lessons/07_planning.md#options).

The goal here is to differentiate both **ability** _and_ **interest**, at least to some degree. Though neither factor is completely ideal, at least combining the two is something new and fun for students.
