## Nvidia AI turns images into 3D scene

### Description
Not long ago, Google showed off its AI technology by [turning black-and-white photos into colorized photos](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/google-photos-colorize-gallery/). Nvidia has apparently leap-frogged that technology by turning a few still 2D images in a 3D-rendered scene. The technology uses NeRF, or "neural radiance fields", which essentially makes connections between images using color and light intensity and uses that data to generate a 3D scene that can be navigated into multiple perspectives.

Other considerable talking points:
* What could this be used for? 
* What technology could this lead to next?

### Rationale

I chose this story because I've always been fascinated by any sort of 3D "scanning" technology. For example, to get custom in-ear monitors, I went to an audiologist who took an impression of my ear canal and then sent it off to California to have a custom mold of my ear canal made (but with headphone drivers inside; essentially custom earplug/headphones). But had I lived in California, I could go directly to the headphone manufacturer who has a device that uses 3D technology to scan the customer's ear canal and uses that to print a 3D custom in-ear monitor. This article makes me wonder if audiologists performing goo-injected ear impressions might become a thing of the past if soon we're able to use our phones to take photos of our ear canals and use that data to 3D print custom in-ear monitors.
